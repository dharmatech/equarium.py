# 004 physics

**Status:** Charter and spec agreed with the user (2026-11-08).
Increments 001, symbols and chapter 2, and 002, chapters 3 and 4
renamed, are done and reviewed. The rename is complete. Checkpoint 003,
polar and degrees, is written (2026-11-09).

The physics layer's redesign: structured symbols that keep their
meaning, one naming rule, the dimension set once, and helpers for
polar form, events, the projectile setup and Newton's laws. The core
doesn't change. It runs as a charter, a spec and checkpoints.

- [charter.md](charter.md): the handoff. What the old physics code
  taught, what the prototype showed, what is decided, the design
  questions, candidate increments, and how to work.
- [spec.md](spec.md): what was decided, the sketches of 2.4, 2.5, 3.10
  and 4.5, and the seven increments with their checks.
- `checkpoints/`: one per increment, written when the one before has
  landed and been reviewed.

**Where:** branch `2026-11-08-physics-redesign`, from tag `v0.1.0`
(`3370e5d`), which is the core with the old physics code. Every commit
of this series goes on the branch. It merges into `master` at the end,
as version 0.2.0, when the user chooses.

The spec was designed from the charter in its own conversation. To
implement a checkpoint, give a new conversation this, with the
checkpoint's file name:

> Read `docs/design/implementation/004-physics/checkpoints/003-polar-and-degrees.md`
> in `~/journal/2026-11-06-equations/equarium.py`, on the branch
> `2026-11-08-physics-redesign`. If you've been told to read that
> file, it is the whole assignment.

## Increments

From the [spec](spec.md#increments). 2 of 7 done. 001 and 002 rename
only; 003 to 006 change equations; 007 removes the old copy.

| # | Increment | Checkpoint | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | symbols and chapter 2 | [001](checkpoints/001-symbols-and-chapter-2.md) | Done, reviewed (2026-11-08) | `6bf4296` |
| 002 | chapters 3 and 4, renamed | [002](checkpoints/002-chapters-3-and-4-renamed.md) | Done, reviewed (2026-11-08) | `a5f848d` |
| 003 | polar and degrees | [003](checkpoints/003-polar-and-degrees.md) | Checkpoint written (2026-11-09) | |
| 004 | events | | Not started | |
| 005 | the projectile setup | | Not started | |
| 006 | Newton on the edge | | Not started | |
| 007 | the end | | Not started | |

## Decisions

The spec has them all. The ones the user settled (2026-11-08):

- **An owner's name is its identity.** Two `Particle("m", …)` are the
  same particle, with the same symbols. No hidden key.
- **The dimension is a type:** `X`, `Y` or `XY`, so pyright flags
  `m0.pos.y` in an x-only model.
- **The steps the helpers make unnecessary are dropped:** 3.6's
  `eliminate(m01.dt)`, 3.8's two by-hand eliminations, and 3.9's
  `eliminating()`.
- **Book notation is glued, as the book's text reads:** `x0`, `v0x`,
  `ax`, `vP0x`, with `Δt` and `α`.

## What's next

Increment 003, polar and degrees, the first increment that changes
equations. Its [checkpoint](checkpoints/003-polar-and-degrees.md) is
written (2026-11-09). Its scratch run found that no formula changes
once renamed back: the equations and the names change, but all 66 old
formulas and 3.10's show-that come back verbatim. For that, 003 adds a
per-module map to `tests/old_names.py`, for the names an old script
made itself, such as 3.6's `dist`. The test rule for a row whose
formula does change is designed in the checkpoint, and built by the
first increment that needs it, likely 005. 3.9 and 3.10 leave
`SLOW_EXAMPLES`: one way, they import in 1.7 s and 4.1 s.

The review of 001 (2026-11-08) found nothing to fix. 294 fast tests and
8 slow ones pass, pyright reports 0 errors, and all 66 old formulas
come back verbatim. One note for later: `BookNotation`'s `owners` is a
dict, so a `BookNotation` can't be hashed. Nothing hashes one yet.

The review of 002 (2026-11-08) found nothing to fix. 315 fast tests and
8 slow ones pass, pyright reports 0 errors, and all 66 old formulas and
3.10's show-that come back verbatim. No example imports the old copy
any more. Two notes for later:

- Pyright types `m * F1` as a SymPy `Expr`, from SymPy's own
  `Expr.__mul__`, though at run time it is a `Vec`. So `.eq(m * a)`
  would be a type error. Examples write `a * m`, and 006's `newton`
  builds the product itself.
- `BookNotation` treats a `Var` with an empty `where` as a lone
  vector's. Events (`meet.t`, 004) and the mass (`b.mass`, 006) have an
  empty `where` too, so their rows go before that branch.

Found while writing the spec, for a later series (the core doesn't
change in this one): labels for generated equations, `show(symbol=…)`,
and `clear_zero_denominators`, which no example needs once 3.6 uses the
projectile setup.
